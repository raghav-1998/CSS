**Cascading Style Sheet**:

CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.

**What is CSS?**
1. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
3. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
4. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

**Why Use CSS??**

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

**Example**:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!


**CSS Syntax**:

h1{
    color:red;
}

This styles text color of all h1 tag to red

h1:selector
color:attribute
red:value

1. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
2. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
3. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
4. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
